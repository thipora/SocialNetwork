This project focused on developing a collaborative application for managing posts, comments, albums, and task lists. Server-side development was done using Node.js to handle requests and build a secure, efficient infrastructure. MySQL was used for database management to store and organize data systematically. On the client side, I developed a dynamic and user-friendly interface using React and JavaScript.
